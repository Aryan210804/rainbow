🌈 Rainbow Spiral Pattern using Python Turtle
This project generates a stunning rainbow spiral using Python's built-in turtle graphics module. The spiral is drawn with a colorful blend of the seven rainbow colors and a soft blue background, resulting in an eye-catching geometric design.

🖼️ Output Preview
The spiral expands infinitely, rotating at a 51° angle, while the line width gradually increases. The rainbow color sequence repeats to produce a mesmerizing visual effect on a soft blue canvas.
